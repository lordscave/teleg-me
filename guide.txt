Guide to launch Euphoria-2
We are forking Euphoria-2 from Euphoria-1 at block height 2000000.

For validators who choose to not run Euphoria-2, please unbond and send back test tokens to our faucet address.

For those who want to support Euphoria-2, please follow steps below:

Note: To ensure the down time as little as possible, validators should init Euphoria-2 on the new machine, or on the same machine with Euphoria-1 but different home directory

Download the latest Aura daemon
git clone --branch euphoria_v0.4.1 https://github.com/aura-nw/aura
cd aura
make
Init the Euphoria-2 home folder
export $HOME_PATH=<Euphoria-2 directory>
aurad init <moniker> --home $HOME_PATH
